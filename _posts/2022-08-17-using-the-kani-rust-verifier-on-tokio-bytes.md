title:  "Using the Kani Rust Verifier on Tokio Bytes"
---

In this post we'll apply the [Kani Rust Verifier](https://github.com/model-checking/kani) (or Kani for short), our open-source formal verification tool that can prove properties about Rust code, to an example from [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Tokio is an [*asynchronous runtime*](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial) for Rust programs, meaning that it abstracts the low-level async capabilities of the language into useful building blocks (such as providing an executor for the scheduling and execution of async tasks).
The aim of Tokio is to provide the _"building blocks needed for writing network applications [with] the flexibility to target a wide range of systems, from large servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices"_.
In this post we will focus on a low-level component of the Tokio stack and proving properties about a core data structure.

## Diving into `Bytes::BytesMut`

At the bottom of the Tokio stack is the [Bytes](https://github.com/tokio-rs/bytes) library, a _"rich set of utilities for manipulating byte arrays"_, which reflects the fact that networking applications, at their core, have to manipulate byte streams.
Inside the library are two container types:
- `Bytes`: a cheaply cloneable and sliceable chunk of contiguous memory
- `BytesMut`: a unique reference to a (potentially shared) contiguous slice of memory
  
As the names suggest, the bytes pointed to by a `Bytes` instance are immutable whereas they are mutable through a `BytesMut` instance.
In this post we'll focus on `BytesMut`.
Let's start with its definition:

```rust
pub struct BytesMut {
    ptr: NonNull<u8>,
    len: usize,
    cap: usize,
    data: *mut Shared,
}

struct Shared {
    vec: Vec<u8>,
    original_capacity_repr: usize,
    ref_count: AtomicUsize,
}
```

The straightforward part is the first three fields.
Similar to a `Vec<u8>`, we have a pointer `ptr` to the backing buffer of size `cap` bytes with `len` bytes currently in use.
The field `data` is a bit trickier because it handles sharing of the backing buffer.
In particular, `data` is used to distinguish between two representation modes: `KIND_VEC` and `KIND_ARC`.
- A `KIND_VEC` is used when the backing buffer is only pointed to by `ptr`.
In this case, `data` is not used as a pointer but instead contains a sentinel value (the bottom bit is set to `'0b1`) to mark that we're using this representation.
- A `KIND_ARC` is used when the backing buffer is shared by multiple `BytesMut` instances.
In this case, each instance's `data` field points to a single `Shared` object whose `ref_count` keeps track of the number of aliases.
In order for this aliasing to be safe, the implementation must ensure that each instance `ptr` field points to a disjoint part of the slice.
[Additionally, the rules for [pointer alignment](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#pointers-and-references-layout), and the fact that `Shared` has `align > 1`, ensure that we will never mix up representations.]

As a user of `BytesMut` you don't need to worry about this distinction.
Under the hood, the implementation will switch representations as required [and, within the library implementation, we can use the private method `kind()` to query the representation of a given instance].
A simplified state machine of when the representation changes is as follows:

<img src="{{site.baseurl | prepend: site.url}}/assets/diagrams/bytes-mut-fsm.png"/>

Constructors such as `new()` (and others like `with_capacity()` and `zeroed()`) create fresh instances of `BytesMut`.
By construction, these are `KIND_VEC` since there is exactly one instance that points to the backing buffer: the one we are creating.

Operations like `split_off(&mut self, at: usize) -> BytesMut` (and others like `split()` and `split_to()`) allow us to split the bytes into two segments.
In the case of `split_off`, we split at the index `at` so that afterwards `self` contains elements `[0, at)` and the returned `BytesMut` contains elements `[at, cap)`.
Internally this means that, after the call, both `self` and the returned `BytesMut` must be `KIND_ARC`.
For example:

```rust
let mut a = BytesMut::from(&b"helloworld"[..]);
// After the constructor, memory looks like:
//
//                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
// a.ptr o──────────► [ h e l l o w o r l d ]
// a.len = 10
// a.cap = 10
// a.data = 0x1 (KIND_VEC)

let mut b = a.split_off(5);
// After splitting, memory looks like:
//
//                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
// a.ptr o──────────► [ h e l l o w o r l d ]
// a.len = 5                      ▲
// a.cap = 5                      │
// a.data = &shared (KIND_ARC)    │
//                                │
// b.ptr o────────────────────────┘
// b.len = 5
// b.cap = 5
// b.data = &shared (KIND_ARC)
//
// shared.ref_count = 2
assert_eq!(&a[..], b"hello");
assert_eq!(&b[..], b"world");
```

Notice that after the `split_off` operation, both `a` and `b` share the same backing buffer (`ref_count` is `2`) but point to disjoint slices.

Finally, it is possible for the representation to return from `KIND_ARC` back to `KIND_VEC` using `reserve(&mut self, additional:usize)`, which ensures that there is capacity for at least `additional` more bytes to be inserted.
If `self` does not have sufficient space, then a fresh backing buffer is allocated and the contents of the original are copied over.
Continuing from our example above:

```rust
b.reserve(3);
// Now memory looks like:
//                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
// a.ptr o──────────► [ h e l l o w o r l d ]
// a.len = 5
// a.cap = 5
// a.data = &shared (KIND_ARC)
//                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
// b.ptr o──────────► [ w o r l d . . .] (fresh buffer)
// b.len = 5
// b.cap = 8
// b.data = 0x1 (KIND_VEC)
//
// shared.ref_count = 1
```

After the `reserve` operation, the `ref_count` is `1` since only `a` has elements in the original backing buffer and a fresh buffer has been allocated for `b` with sufficient space for `3` additional bytes.[^footnote-refcount]

## Using Kani

To show how Tokio developers could integrate Kani proofs, we will add our examples to (a fork of) the `BytesMut` implementation.
This has the advantage that the implementation details will be visible to our proofs.
Like previous posts, all the code and instructions for reproducing the results of this post yourself are available (see [Further Reading](#further-reading)).

### A simple example

Let's begin with a straightforward test that could equally well be a unit test: the code we used above.

```rust
#[cfg(kani)]
mod verification {
    #[kani::proof]
    fn test_kind_representation_change() {
        let mut a = BytesMut::from(&b"helloworld"[..]);
        assert!(a.kind() == KIND_VEC);
        let mut b = a.split_off(5);
        assert!(a.kind() == KIND_ARC);
        assert!(b.kind() == KIND_ARC);
        assert!(&a[..] == b"hello");
        assert!(&b[..] == b"world");
        b.reserve(3);
        assert!(b.kind() == KIND_VEC);
    }
}
```

As you'd expect, this has no problems and confirms the behavior explained above.
In this particular case, there is no advantage to using Kani rather than running the test, but it is nice to show Kani handling code that internally uses unsafe Rust.

```bash
$ cargo kani --harness test_kind_representation_change
# --snip--
VERIFICATION:- SUCCESSFUL
```

### Representation invariants and ghost state

In our [earlier post](https://model-checking.github.io/kani-verifier-blog/2022/06/01/using-the-kani-rust-verifier-on-a-rust-standard-library-cve.html) on using Kani with the Rust Standard Library, we introduced *representation invariants*: properties that should *always hold* for any instance of a data type.
If an instance of a data type satisfies its representation invariant we say the instance is *well-formed*.
Since `BytesMut` has two different representations we need to think about what properties each of them need.
Let's begin with a property that should hold regardless of the representation: the instance's length must be within bounds of its capacity.
We will also add calls to appropriate methods, to be defined, for each representation kind.
In Kani, we can write a method `is_valid` to express when a type `T` is well-formed:

```rust
impl BytesMut {
    fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {
        self.len <= self.cap
            && match self.kind() {
                KIND_VEC => self.is_valid_kind_vec(),
                KIND_ARC => self.is_valid_kind_arc(),
                _ => false,
            }
    }
}
```

For `KIND_VEC` we need to know a bit more about how a `BytesMut` is constructed.
The implementation, which we've slightly simplified (just in this post), is as follows.
Internally the constructor allocates the backing buffer inside a `Vec<u8>` with sufficient capacity.
The `BytesMut` instance is then built out of the fields of the vector.

```rust
impl BytesMut {
    pub fn with_capacity(capacity: usize) -> BytesMut {
        BytesMut::from_vec(Vec::with_capacity(capacity)) //< (1)
    }

    pub(crate) fn from_vec(mut vec: Vec<u8>) -> BytesMut {
        let ptr = vptr(vec.as_mut_ptr());                //< (2)
        let len = vec.len();                             //<
        let cap = vec.capacity();                        //<
        mem::forget(vec);                                //< (3)

        let data = KIND_VEC;                             //< (4)

        BytesMut {
            ptr,
            len,
            cap,
            data: data as *mut _,
        }
    }
}
```

In the above, we've annotated the steps:
1. A `Vec<u8>` is used to allocate a buffer of the requested capacity
2. Set `ptr` to point to the `vec`'s buffer ([`as_mut_ptr()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_mut_ptr) returns the raw pointer (`*mut u8`) and `vptr()`, an internal function, turns this into a `NonNull<u8>`)
3. Use [`mem::forget`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.forget.html) to ensure that `vec`'s destructor will *not* run when `from_vec` returns (notice that `vec` is moved into `from_vec`).
This is essential to ensure that the buffer pointed to by `ptr` remains valid.
4. Set `data` to `KIND_VEC` (`=0b1`), which is subsequently cast to a raw pointer `*mut Shared`

This is interesting, but unfortunately there is not a great deal more we can say for `is_valid_kind_vec()`.
If we have an instance using `KIND_VEC` then we know that the `ptr` and `cap` must be related to the "original vector".
For example, immediately after construction, we know `ptr` must be exactly `vec`'s buffer and similarly for `cap`.
However, we no longer have access to this `vec`, so for now we will make our well-formedness check a no-op.
[Don't worry, we will return to this later!]

```rust
fn is_valid_kind_vec(&self) -> bool {
    assert!(self.kind() == KIND_VEC);
    true
}
```

Let's now turn to the `KIND_ARC` case.
Here we are more fortunate because we have the `Shared` object pointed to by the `data` field of the `BytesMut` instance.
As a reminder, here's what the `Shared` struct looks like:

```rust
struct Shared {
    vec: Vec<u8>,
    original_capacity_repr: usize,
    ref_count: AtomicUsize,
}
```

The `ref_count` is the number of references (including the instance, itself) to the backing buffer.
For this reason, we know that `ref_count` *must* be at least `1`.
Secondly, `vec` is the "original vector" that we have derived our instance's slice from.
[We will ignore `original_capacity_repr` which is used to ensure that `reserve` always allocates sufficient bytes.]
Having this "in our hands" is useful because it must be the case that the `ptr` is within `vec`'s buffer, and similarly for capacity.
Putting this together:

```rust
fn is_valid_kind_arc(&self) -> bool {
    assert!(self.kind() == KIND_ARC);
    let shared: *mut Shared = self.data as _;
    unsafe {
        let ref_count = (*shared).ref_count.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
        let valid_ref_count = 1 <= ref_count;

        let vec_ptr = (*shared).vec.as_mut_ptr();
        let vec_cap = (*shared).vec.capacity();
        let vec_end_ptr = vec_ptr.offset(vec_cap as isize);
        let ptr = self.ptr.as_ptr();
        let ptr_in_bounds = vec_ptr <= ptr && ptr <= vec_end_ptr;
        let cap_in_bounds = self.cap <= vec_cap;

        valid_ref_count && ptr_in_bounds && cap_in_bounds
    }
}
```

This gives us an idea!
What if we could keep track of the original vector for `KIND_VEC` too?
The use of program state that is just for verification is known as *ghost state*, originally called [auxiliary variables](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/360051.360224).
You can think of it as metadata only for the purposes of Kani, that can be ignored by compilation (and hence has no runtime cost[^footnote-layout]).
Here's what we need:

```rust
pub struct BytesMut {
    //--snip-- (all the original fields)
    #[cfg(kani)]
    ghost: Ghost,
}

// State used by verification
#[cfg(kani)]
struct Ghost {
    original_vec_ptr: NonNull<u8>,
    original_len: usize,
    original_cap: usize,
}

impl BytesMut {
    pub(crate) fn from_vec(mut vec: Vec<u8>) -> BytesMut {
        //--snip-- (the constructor as before)

        BytesMut {
            ptr,
            len,
            cap,
            data: data as *mut _,
            #[cfg(kani)]
            ghost: Ghost {
                original_vec_ptr: ptr,
                original_len: len,
                original_cap: cap,
            },
        }
    }
}
```

The idea is that when we construct a `BytesMut` we'll "save" information about the original `vec` so that we can use it later.
Here we are fortunate that `BytesMut` only has one "root constructor" so we only have to make a single change.
With this in hand, we can re-write our well-formedness check for `KIND_VEC`.
Notice that we allow `ptr` and `cap` so long as they are in bounds (rather than being an exact match).
This is because there are `BytesMut` operations, such as [`advance`](https://docs.rs/bytes/latest/bytes/buf/trait.Buf.html#tymethod.advance), that modify these fields.

```rust
fn is_valid_kind_vec(&self) -> bool {
    assert!(self.kind() == KIND_VEC);
    let vec_ptr = self.ghost.original_vec_ptr.as_ptr();
    let vec_cap = self.ghost.original_cap;
    let vec_end_ptr = unsafe { vec_ptr.offset(vec_cap as isize) };
    let ptr = self.ptr.as_ptr();
    let ptr_in_bounds = vec_ptr <= ptr && ptr <= vec_end_ptr;
    let cap_in_bounds = self.cap <= vec_cap;

    ptr_in_bounds && cap_in_bounds
}
```

Phew, that was a bit of work!
But now we have a property (a representation invariant) that should *always hold* for any instance of `BytesMut`.

### A proof about `with_capacity()`

Let's try and use our representation invariant.
How about proving that the `BytesMut` constructor `with_capacity()` always returns a well-formed instance?
In [earlier posts](https://model-checking.github.io/kani-verifier-blog/2022/05/04/announcing-the-kani-rust-verifier-project.html#enter-kani) we introduced Kani [`any<T>()`](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/tutorial-nondeterministic-variables.html).
This is a feature that informally generates "any `T` value".
This is not the same as a randomly chosen concrete value (as in fuzzing) but rather a *symbolic* value that represents any possible value of the appropriate type.
The key idea is that we can use `any` in a Kani harness to verify the behavior of our code with respect to all possible values of an input (rather than having to exhaustively enumerate them).
For example, we can write a harness that uses `any<usize>()` to call `with_capacity` and subsequently assert that the returned `BytesMut` instance is well-formed.

```rust
#[cfg(kani)]
mod verification {
    use super::*;

    #[kani::proof]
    fn with_capacity_returns_well_formed_bytes_mut() {
        let cap = kani::any();
        kani::assume(0 < cap);                   //< (1)
        kani::assume(cap < MAX_KANI_ALLOCATION); //< (2)
        let a = BytesMut::with_capacity(cap);
        assert!(a.kind() == KIND_VEC);
        assert!(a.is_valid());
    }
}
```

There are two assumptions that we will return to shortly, but first we note Kani has no problem proving this harness:

```bash
$ cargo kani --harness with_capacity_returns_well_formed_bytes_mut --output-format terse
#--snip--
VERIFICATION RESULT: 
 ** 0 of 410 failed

VERIFICATION:- SUCCESSFUL
```

The two assumptions are needed for different reasons.
The first assumption `(1)` avoids constructing a vector with capacity `0`.
This doesn't sound tricky except that the `Vec` implementation uses a dangling pointer to represent vectors with capacity `0`.
And we have an [open question](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/219381-t-libs/topic/Behavior.20of.20dangling.20pointer.20arithmetic.20operations) with the unsafe-wg about what operations are legal on such a dangling pointer.
For now, using this assumption avoids this case.

The second assumption`(2)` is necessary because Kani's abstract machine uses a fixed (but parameterizable) number of bits in a pointer for its analysis (to track allocated objects).
By default, Kani's maximum allocation is `2^47` bytes (whereas the documentation for `vec` states a maximum allocation of `isize::MAX == 2^63 - 1 bytes`).
Currently Kani does not error if an allocation exceeds this bound so this assumption avoids this case.

With these two assumptions, Kani verifies the proof harness effectively checks all invocations of `with_capacity()` with `cap` ranging from `[1..2^47)`.

### A proof about `split_off`

Next let's turn our attention to the `split_off` method.
We would like to show that the method *maintains* our representation invariant: for any well-formed `self: BytesMut` instance (i.e., that satisfies `is_valid()`) calling `split_off` leaves `self` well-formed and returns a new well-formed instance.
Here's a proof harness where we add an assumption at `(1)` to handle the fact that the [docs](https://docs.rs/bytes/latest/bytes/struct.BytesMut.html#method.split_off) state that `split_off` panics if `at > capacity`.

```rust
#[cfg(kani)]
mod verification {
    #[kani::proof]
    fn split_off_maintains_well_formed() {
        let mut a = kani::any();
        let at = kani::any();
        kani::assume(at <= a.capacity()); //< (1)
        let b = a.split_off(at);
        assert!(a.is_valid());
        assert!(b.is_valid());
    }
}
```

We need one more ingredient to make this work.
Unlike uses of `kani::any()` in past blog posts, we need `kani::any()` to return a symbolic *heap-allocated* object for `a` (i.e., the backing buffer pointed to by `buf`).
In this case, Kani provides the [`Arbitrary` trait](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/tutorial-nondeterministic-variables.html).
This requires us to implement `any` to *construct* a symbolic well-formed instance.
In effect, we need to write a "verification-friendly" constructor that uses symbolic values (e.g., for the size of the backing buffer) to call other methods (e.g., `with_capacity()`) to ensure proper heap-allocation.

```rust
#[cfg(kani)]
impl kani::Arbitrary for BytesMut {
    fn any() -> Self {
        let cap = kani::any();
        kani::assume(0 < cap);
        kani::assume(cap < MAX_KANI_ALLOCATION);
        let b = BytesMut::with_capacity(cap);          //< (1)
        let make_kind_arc = kani::any();               //< (2)
        if make_kind_arc {
            // --snip-- (elided)
        } else {
            // len set within buffer cap
            let len = kani::any();
            kani::assume(len <= cap);
            b.len = len;                               //< (3)
        }

        assert!(b.is_valid());
        b
    }
}
```

At `(1)` we create a new `BytesMut` instance using a symbolic capacity `cap`.
Thanks to our previous proof harness `with_capacity_returns_well_formed_bytes_mut` we know this returns a well-formed instance using `KIND_VEC`.
At `(2)` we use `kani::any()` to pick a symbolic Boolean value, which we use to decide whether to turn the instance into a `KIND_ARC` or to remain as a `KIND_VEC`.
By making `make_kind_arc` symbolic we enable Kani to explore both possibilities (i.e., produce both well-formed `KIND_ARC` and `KIND_VEC` instances).
For brevity, we'll focus on the case where we remain as a `KIND_VEC`.
After `(1)` we have an empty (`len == 0`) instance using `KIND_VEC`.
To make a less constrained instance at `(3)` we update `len` to index anywhere between `[0, cap]`.[^footnote-uninit-mem]
The `KIND_ARC` case is similar, except we deal with `b.data` too (e.g., setting `ref_count` to a symbolic value where `1 <= ref_count`).

Suitably equiped with this symbolic constructor, Kani takes about a minute to analyze our harness successfully.

```bash
$ cargo kani --harness split_off_maintains_well_formed --output-format terse
#--snip--
VERIFICATION RESULT: 
 ** 0 of 410 failed

VERIFICATION:- SUCCESSFUL
```

This result proves a *specification* for `split_off`:
- Assuming that the instance is well-formed and the requested index `at` is within bounds (the *precondition*)
- Then calling `split_off` will not panic and the updated instance and its return value are both well-formed (the *postcondition*).

Why does this matter?
This result gives us assurance that this is true for any well-formed `BytesMut` (using either representation).
A way to approximate the power of this approach is to think about the number of test cases we would need to write to get the same level of assurance.
Just taking the case of a `KIND_VEC`, we consider any sized backing buffer size up to `MAX_KANI_ALLOCATION (= 2^47)` bytes and allow `len` to take any index within this range.
This is on the order of `2^47 * 2^47 = 2^94` different test cases (a large number!).

### About specifications

Like all results from automated reasoning tools, the result we have for `split_off` hinges on assumptions that must be reviewed to ensure they are reasonable.
The most important consideration is the specification itself, which you can think of as being a "contract" that tells you if the client or user of `BytesMut` adheres to the specification's requirements (i.e., the precondition) then the proof result guarantees certain properties (i.e., the postcondition).
For example, if a client performed unsafe operations to make a `BytesMut` instance not well-formed (such as setting `ptr` to point outside of the backing buffer) then the proof result no longer applies (because the precondition is not satisfied).
In this sense, it's important to ensure that the precondition accurately reflects how the method will be used.

Similar considerations apply to the postcondition.
Notice that the proof harness does *not* check that `split_off` performs a split at the index `at`.
Since we only check for well-formedness, an implementation of `split_off` that always split at index `0` would satisfy our specification even though it wouldn't be accurately reflecting our expectations.
A good exercise would be to add appropriate assertions to the proof harness to give us this property too.[^footnote-split-of-postcondition]

## Summary

In this post, we worked with Tokio bytes and focused on its `BytesMut` implementation.
We encoded a representation invariant using ghost state (program state just for the purpose of verification).
Using Kani we proved that the constructor `with_capacity()` always returns a well-formed instance and that `split_off` maintains this invariant and discussed what this specification means.
As future work, we could apply Kani to ensure that all API functions of `BytesMut` maintain this invariant, which would show that any instance is well-formed.
[In fact, if you look at our code you can see that we implemented proof harnesses for 6 further API functions.]

To test drive Kani yourself, check out our [“getting started” guide](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/getting-started.html).
We have a one-step install process and examples, including all the code in this post with instructions on reproducing the results yourself, so you can try proving your code today.

## Footnotes

[^footnote-refcount]: 
    You may wonder why the type of `ref_count` is `AtomicUsize` and not just `usize`.
    The reason is that `BytesMut` is `Send` and `Sync` (i.e., safe to send to another thread and safe to share between threads).
    Consequently, the same backing buffer may be shared by `BytesMut` instances owned by different threads.
    
    Consider two threads that call `split` on their `BytesMut` instance at the same time.
    In this case there is a potential race for each thread to increment `shared.ref_count`.
    Imagine if `ref_count` was just `usize` and each thread effectively tried `ref_count += 1`.
    The problem is that this involves both a read (to get the current value) and a write (to set the incremented value).
    This means it is possible to lose an update:
    
    ```
    Thread 1              || Thread 2
    reads ref_count as 2  ||
                          || reads ref_count as 2
                          || compute 2 + 1
                          || writes ref_count to 3
    compute 2 + 1         ||
    writes ref_count to 3 ||
    ```
    
    This is a bad outcome because it's now possible for the backing buffer to be dropped (when `ref_count` is decremented to `0`) whilst a `BytesMut` instance still points to it (a potential use-after-free error).
    
    By using [`atomic operations`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/) we are guaranteed that we will never lose an update.
    So it's essential that the type of `ref_count` is `AtomicUSize`.
    [In fact, a strict reading of Rust's [*atomic memory model*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html), which specifies the behavior of concurrent shared memory programs, is that a `ref_count` implementation using non-atomics is *undefined* since it involves a non-atomic data race.]

[^footnote-layout]: Note that this will change the layout in Kani.

[^footnote-uninit-mem]:
    You may wonder whether this update to `len` is safe.
    The valid elements of a `BytesMut` instance are between `[ptr..ptr+len)` so setting `len` to an arbitrary position (within `cap`) allows potentially uninitialized memory to be read, which is [undefined behavior](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html#behavior-considered-undefined).
    
    Kani's allocator gives symbolic (but initialized) values for freshly allocated objects.
    [This is analogous to a custom allocator that always returns initialized (e.g., zeroed) memory.]
    Under this (more restricted) allocation scheme the update to `len` in our implementation of `any()` is safe.
    In order for Kani to detect this kind of undefined behavior in the future, we will need to add [a way to track uninitialized memory](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/920).

[^footnote-split-of-postcondition]:

    Here's one possibility:
    
    ```rust
    #[kani::proof]
    fn split_off_maintains_well_formed() {
        let mut a: BytesMut = kani::any();
        let at = kani::any();
        kani::assume(at <= a.capacity());
        let b = a.split_off(at);
        assert!(a.is_valid());
        assert!(b.is_valid());
        // Additional checks that the operation does what we expect
        assert!(a.cap == at);
        unsafe {
            assert!(b.ptr.as_ptr() == a.ptr.as_ptr().offset(at as isize));
        }
    }
    ```
